# AI-based Assessments 
## What makes ‘Adaptive Assessments’ one of the finest evaluation tools for present-age learners
Gone are the days when examinations were more overwhelming than challenging, and only a one-size-fits-all pattern was followed to test a student’s level of understanding. The Education Ecosystem around the globe is shifting from traditional evaluation methods toward a technology-driven world, that too at a warp speed. With the proliferation of technology, especially in the education sector, personalised learning and assessment have become one of the most lucrative evaluation models for both learners and educators. In today’s era, adaptive assessments have become an efficient evaluation tool to gauge students’ diverse learning abilities.

**1. What are Adaptive Assessments?**

Adaptive assessments are AI (artificial intelligence) online assessments tailored according to the learning abilities of a student. Starting with a medium-level question, the difficulty level of the questions is further raised or reduced based on an algorithm that gauges students’ understanding of concepts. 

**2. Adaptive Assessments and Item Response Theory (IRT)**

Most Adaptive examinations are based on IRT and have multiple advantages when compared to traditional paper-based examinations. Adaptive assessments use IRT to select items that are appropriate for each test-taker's ability level. 

-	In Adaptive Assessments, the questions are based on students’ response patterns. 
-	If a student answers the question correctly, the algorithm will present a slightly tricky question to challenge his/her cognitive ability. 
-	If a student is struggling to give the correct answers, he/she will get a somewhat easier question. These tests act as a baseline for understanding the full-range capabilities of a student. 
-	When a certain level of psychometric precision is reached after ‘n’ attempts, the assessment is concluded.

In an adaptive assessment:

•	The first item presented to the test-taker is typically of moderate difficulty.

•	Based on the test-taker's response to this item, the system selects the next item (question) to present. 

•	If the test-taker answered the first item correctly, the next item will be slightly more difficult; if they answered it incorrectly, the next item will be slightly easier. 

•	The process continues until the system has a good estimate of the test-taker's ability level. Once, a certain level is reached, the test will terminate.

**3. Benefits of Adaptive Assessments**

Adaptive assessments are ideal for:

•	Examining the varied abilities of different students as questions are matched according to student's learning abilities and not vice-versa. 

•	Ensuring that students are in their learning zones while being evaluated based on their intellectual capabilities. 

•	Reducing students’ pressure and burden of attaining the set benchmark scores for proving their mettle. 

•	It’s a more student-friendly approach to test-taking and also boosts their morale. There are multiple advantages and benefits of adaptive tests.

**- Facilitates Personalised Evaluation** 

Each student has different interests and abilities that develop at different rates. Learning is a personal experience, after all. A generalised test approach in which they are evaluated on just a few parameters will lead to unsatisfactory school performance. In such a scenario, students need help in identifying the areas where they are lacking. Most of the time, they will not get a clear picture of their struggling areas and how they can overcome them.

On the other hand, Adaptive tests ensure a personalised evaluation approach for students so that they get a comprehensive understanding of their weaker areas as well as a clear overview of their learning outcome. Once they identify their areas of improvement, they can focus more on working out those specific topics and channel their energy to enhance their learning. A personalised assessment will help the students recognise their strengths and weaknesses and deliver an excellent result based on the thorough aspects of their understanding and learning.


**- Fosters Positive Examination Experience**

Unlike traditional evaluation, in an adaptive evaluation, students gain a more positive test-taking experience. As each of them is challenged as per their cognitive strengths, all levels of examinees are encouraged to try hard and do the best of their potential without getting intimidated by the questions asked in the test. 

In an Adaptive Test, the complexity of questions for assessing students solely depends on their intellectual prowess. Those with a higher cognitive level will be presented with questions that appropriately challenge their mental capabilities. Whereas those with somewhat lesser cognitive abilities will attempt the assessment with much ease and comfort, knowing that the test automatically adapts to their level of intelligence.


**- Promotes Self-Learning**

In Adaptive Assessment, no two students get a similar set of questions. Questions in an adaptive test are tailor-made as per the understanding and knowledge level of the student. Therefore, students need not scratch their heads or struggle too hard with questions which are very difficult. The test helps students stay motivated and driven while finding out the solutions to the different levels of questions and improving their performance, thus fostering personalised learning and growth.


**- Provides an accurate judgment of students’ learning progress**

Adaptive Assessments are one of the most effective ways to measure students’ strengths and weaknesses and areas of interest. These assessments provide thorough analytics of students’ academic progress by analysing their pattern of answering the questions. After the final score calculation, students get a clear picture of their ranking on the academic performance scale vis-a-vis their peers. 

The feedback from the test provides a fair, accurate and detailed overview of their performance. Two students might get receive the same number of questions and might as well have correctly answered the exact numbers, but the student who answered more advanced questions from the difficult set will receive a higher score/ranking than the student who has received a lesser difficult set of questions. 


**5.Closing Remarks**

Adaptive assessments not only measure the academic disparity while identifying the reasons for learning gaps among students but also generates more detailed and personalised feedback on their performance by analysing the number, type, and complexity of questions and the total time they’ve taken to submit the answers. This fair analysis of a student’s academic capabilities will help both students and educators take suitable measures to eliminate the learning gaps and improve their academic status. Educators use test statistics to recommend relevant resources and educational support to students for improving their individual performance, irrespective of how their peers perform. And, students get a clear understanding of their strengths and challenges related to specific subjects/concepts.
